        <h3> Quantity Over Quality? </h3>
        <p> This bar chart shows the top 20 countries that have the greatest number of players loaded on FIFA 2020. As you hover over each bar, you can see the specific number of players and the average rating. Some interesting points include that England, despite having the most players counted by FIFA, only has an average rating of 63 overall. In contrast, looking at a country like Portugal which has less than 300 players in the system clearly develops more talented stars, with an average player rating of 71. This begs the question as to whether its more important to develop more players with a wider range of abilities, or focus on a smaller soccer program that could be rated higher. What do you think? </p>
